        <h2>Primitive Data Types:</h2>
        <p>
            <b>String:</b> Sequence of charters. Must be in quotes or backticks.
            <br />
            <b>Number:</b> Integers as well as floating-point numbers. <br />
            <b>Boolean:</b> Logical entity / true OR False. <br />
            <b>Null: </b>Intentional absence of any object value. <br />
            <b>Undefined:</b> A Variable that has not yet been defined /
            assigned. <br />
            <b>Symbol:</b> Built-In object whose constructor returns a unique
            symbol.
            <br />
            <b>BigInt:</b> Numbers that are greater that the "Number" type can
            handle.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Reference Types: (Objects)</h2>
        <p>
            Reference types OR "objects" are a non-primitive value and when
            assigned to a variable, the variable is given a reference to that
            value.
        </p>
        <p>Objects literals, arrays & functions are all reference types.</p>
        <br />

        <h2>Static Typing VS Dynamic Types:</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language: This means, we do not
            explicity define the types for our variables, many other languages
            are statically-typed such as C, C++, Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            Type script: is a superset of JavaScript, which allows
            static-typing. This can make your code more verbose & less prone to
            errors. TypeScript may be something you might want to look into
            further down the road.
